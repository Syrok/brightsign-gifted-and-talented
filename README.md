# Gifted and Talented
The Brown Institute's toolchain for managing our mediawall powered by a bunch of [Brightsign HD1020]().

## Status
Still hypothetical and aspirational

# Background
In the entryway to [The Brown Institute's](http://brown.columbia.edu) at Columbia Journalism School, there are two walls covered with 50 displays of varying sizes behind a pane of two-way glass. It's meant to show past events, advertise upcoming activities, and remarkable work that's meant to inspire students and visitors. For a media wall, it's beautiful. It's also built on top of of a rock-solid technical platform that _juuuust barely_ predates that moment where HTML5 was running on every embedded device. But they've yet to reach their full potential: it's hard to update content and we've never been able to make the screens change content in a coordinated way.
